# Date Range Picker for Twitter Bootstrap

This is a fork from [Dan Grossman daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker).

Just modified it for my own personal needs, like using moment.js instead of Date.js, opening custom dates in a new popup, using my own fork of daterangepicker in it...
